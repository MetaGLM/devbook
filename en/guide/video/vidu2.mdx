### **Detailed Description**

1. **Efficient Video Generation Speed**

With optimized model computing architecture, video rendering efficiency is significantly enhanced. This allows daily content teams to respond quickly to trending topics, and enables e-commerce sellers to mass-produce product display videos on demand—greatly reducing content delivery time and helping creators seize traffic windows.

2. **Cost-effective 720P Output**

The cost of generating 720P resolution videos has dropped to 40% of the Q1 version. Small and medium-sized brands can now create batch videos for multiple SKUs, while advertising teams can test creative concepts like "product close-ups \+ scenario storytelling" at a lower cost—meeting full-platform marketing needs without breaking the content budget.

3. **Stable and Controllable Image-to-Video Generation**

The model addresses the "texture color shift" issue—accurately restoring details like the silky glow of satin or the matte finish of leather in clothing videos. In e-commerce scenarios, product colors are displayed more realistically. Dynamic frame compensation is optimized, ensuring smooth, shake-free motion for rotating 3C products or hand demonstrations in beauty tutorials. Multiple visual styles are supported, enabling eye-catching content like “product close-up \+ stylized camera movement,” ideal for e-commerce main images and short-form promotional videos.
