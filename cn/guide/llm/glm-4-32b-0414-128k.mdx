### **Detailed Description**

GLM-4-32B-0414-128K was pre-trained on 15T of high-quality data, including abundant synthetic reasoning data to lay a solid foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning. In the post-training phase, besides aligning with human preferences in dialogue scenarios, we also applied techniques like rejection sampling and reinforcement learning to enhance instruction following, engineering code generation, and function calling, strengthening the model’s fundamental capabilities for intelligent tasks.

The model performs comparably to much larger domestic and international mainstream models, with some benchmark indicators approaching or even exceeding models like GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3-0324 (671B).
